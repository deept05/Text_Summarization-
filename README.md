# Text_Summarization
### This project involves creating a text summarization tool using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and BeautifulSoup for dataset handling. The tool is designed to automatically generate concise summaries of large bodies of text, making it easier to extract key information.

# Features
- Automatic Text Summarization: The tool condenses lengthy articles or documents into shorter, meaningful summaries.
- Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the dataset for summarization using BeautifulSoup to parse HTML content and NLTK for tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
- Sentence Scoring: Ranks sentences based on their significance to the overall content using frequency-based methods.
- Output Flexibility: Allows users to specify the length of the summary.

# How It Works
## Data Cleaning:
The text data is extracted from the input file using BeautifulSoup. It removes HTML tags and irrelevant content, leaving only the main text for processing.

## Text Preprocessing:
The cleaned text is tokenized into sentences and words. Stopwords are removed, and the remaining words are stemmed using NLTK.

## Sentence Scoring:
Each sentence in the text is scored based on the frequency of significant words it contains. Sentences with higher scores are considered more important.

## Summary Generation:
The top-ranked sentences are selected and combined to form a coherent summary, ensuring that the most critical information is retained.
